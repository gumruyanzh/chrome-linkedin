## Test-First Enforcement

Xavier enforces that tests are written BEFORE implementation. The workflow is:
1. Agent writes comprehensive tests
2. Tests must fail initially (Red)
3. Agent implements minimal code to pass (Green)
4. Agent refactors while keeping tests passing
5. 100% coverage verified before task completion
