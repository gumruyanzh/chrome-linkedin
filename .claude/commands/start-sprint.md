# start-sprint

Begin sprint execution with strict sequential task processing.

## ðŸš€ THIS COMMAND STARTS IMPLEMENTATION

**This is THE ONLY command that begins actual coding work.**

When this command is executed, YOU SHOULD:
- âœ… Start implementing stories and tasks
- âœ… Write tests first (TDD)
- âœ… Write implementation code
- âœ… Create and modify files
- âœ… Follow Clean Code principles
- âœ… Work sequentially through tasks
- âœ… Ensure 100% test coverage

## Usage

Type `/start-sprint` to begin sprint execution.

## Parameters

- **sprint_id**: Sprint ID to start (optional, uses latest planned sprint if not provided)
- **strict_mode**: Enable strict sequential execution (optional, default: true)

## Implementation Process

1. **Select first task** from sprint backlog
2. **Write tests first** - All tests must fail initially
3. **Implement minimal code** to pass tests
4. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
5. **Verify 100% coverage** before moving to next task
6. **Repeat** for each task sequentially

## IMPORTANT

This is the ONLY command that should trigger any implementation work. All other commands are for planning and organization only.

**NOW YOU CAN START CODING!**
