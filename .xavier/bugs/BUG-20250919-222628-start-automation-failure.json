  "title": "Start Automation button fails - pagination elements not found",
  "description": "The Start Automation button does not work properly. When clicked, the automation attempts to start but immediately fails due to missing pagination elements on the LinkedIn search results page. The automation shows 'No name element found in search results' errors and stops with 'No connectable profiles found on this page, stopping automation' message.",
  "stepsToReproduce": [
    "1. Navigate to LinkedIn search results page",
    "2. Open the Chrome extension popup",
