## Product Vision Context

From the mission-lite.md specification, this LinkedIn Chrome Extension serves to "transform manual LinkedIn networking into a systematic, scalable process with smart automation, detailed analytics, and compliance-safe features that increase connection success rates while saving hours of manual work." Task 2's implementation directly fulfills this vision by:

- **Systematic Process:** Established automated workflows with consistent messaging and timing
- **Smart Automation:** Intelligent page detection, dynamic messaging, and safety controls
- **Detailed Analytics:** Comprehensive tracking of all automation activities and success metrics
- **Compliance-Safe Features:** Built-in rate limiting, working hours, and conservative defaults
- **Scalability:** Foundation for bulk operations and advanced campaign management
- **Time Savings:** Automated connection requests that previously required manual clicking and typing

## Original Task 2 Specification Reference

The implementation successfully completed all 8 subtasks defined in the original Task 2 specification:

1. **✅ 2.1 LinkedIn Integration Testing** - Complete test coverage for LinkedIn page detection and DOM parsing
2. **✅ 2.2 Connection Request Automation** - Automated connection sending with safety mechanisms
3. **✅ 2.3 Message Template System** - Dynamic templating with variable substitution
4. **✅ 2.4 Safety and Compliance Features** - Rate limiting and LinkedIn ToS compliance
5. **✅ 2.5 Basic Analytics Collection** - Connection tracking and success rate calculations
