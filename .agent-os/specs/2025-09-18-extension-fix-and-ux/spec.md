> Created: 2025-09-18
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix critical build system failures, non-functional user interface, and broken LinkedIn integration to deliver a production-ready Chrome extension that automates LinkedIn connection requests with proper messaging and profile targeting.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Extension Installation and Setup
**As a** LinkedIn user who wants to automate connection requests
**I want to** install the Chrome extension and have it work immediately without technical issues
**So that** I can start automating my LinkedIn networking without troubleshooting broken functionality

**Workflow:**
1. User installs extension from Chrome Web Store or loads unpacked
2. Extension icon appears in toolbar and is clickable
3. User clicks extension icon and sees functional popup interface
4. User can configure settings and see clear instructions for use

### Story 2: LinkedIn Connection Automation
**As a** professional using LinkedIn for networking
**I want to** automatically send personalized connection requests to targeted profiles
**So that** I can efficiently expand my network without manual repetitive work

**Workflow:**
1. User navigates to LinkedIn search results or profile pages
2. User opens extension popup and configures automation settings
3. User starts automation process with clear feedback and controls
4. Extension processes profiles, sends connection requests with personalized messages
5. User receives clear status updates and can stop/pause the process

### Story 3: Extension Management and Control
**As a** user running LinkedIn automation
**I want to** have full control over the automation process with clear status feedback
**So that** I can manage my LinkedIn activity responsibly and avoid account issues

**Workflow:**
1. User can see current automation status in popup
2. User can start, pause, and stop automation with immediate response
3. User receives real-time feedback on processed profiles and sent requests
4. User can configure delays, limits, and message templates

## Spec Scope

1. **Fix Build System and Asset Loading** - Repair broken Vite configuration, resolve missing file references, fix CSS and asset loading to ensure extension builds and loads properly in Chrome

2. **Restore User Interface Functionality** - Fix non-functional buttons, broken popup interface, missing styles, and communication between popup and background scripts to provide working user controls

3. **Implement Reliable Service Worker Communication** - Establish proper message passing between popup, content scripts, and service worker to enable coordinated automation functionality

4. **Repair LinkedIn Integration and Automation** - Fix content script injection, profile detection, connection request automation, and message personalization to restore core LinkedIn functionality

5. **Enhance User Experience and Safety** - Implement clear status indicators, proper error handling, rate limiting, and user controls to provide professional-grade automation tools

## Out of Scope

- Advanced LinkedIn features beyond connection requests (messaging existing connections, post automation, data extraction)
- Multi-platform support (only Chrome extension, no Firefox or other browsers)
- Cloud-based or server-side functionality (extension remains fully client-side)
- Advanced analytics or reporting features beyond basic success/failure counts

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Chrome Extension** - Extension loads without errors, popup interface works, all buttons and controls are responsive, and users can successfully install and use the extension

2. **Working LinkedIn Automation** - Extension successfully detects LinkedIn profiles, sends connection requests with personalized messages, and provides real-time status feedback to users

3. **Production-Ready User Experience** - Extension includes proper error handling, rate limiting, clear instructions, and professional interface suitable for daily use by LinkedIn professionals
