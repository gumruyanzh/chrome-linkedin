> Spec: UI Redesign with Vintage Classic Newspaper Theme
> Created: 2025-09-18
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the entire Chrome extension interface with a classic newspaper-inspired vintage design using Tailwind CSS to create a professional, cohesive user experience. This redesign will replace the current unprofessional appearance with elegant typography, proper alignment, paper textures, and vintage styling elements while maintaining full functionality.

## User Stories

### Professional Interface Enhancement

As a sales professional using the LinkedIn extension, I want a polished, newspaper-themed interface that looks credible and professional, so that I feel confident using and recommending the tool to colleagues.

The user opens the extension popup and immediately sees a clean, newspaper-style layout with proper typography hierarchy, vintage buttons with subtle textures, and well-aligned form elements that convey trustworthiness and attention to detail.

### Consistent Design Experience

As a user navigating between different pages (popup, dashboard, settings), I want a consistent vintage newspaper design language throughout all interfaces, so that the extension feels like a unified, well-designed product.

All pages share the same design system with vintage color palettes, classic typography, paper textures, and standardized button and input positioning that creates visual harmony across the entire user experience.

### Improved Usability

As a user interacting with forms and controls, I want properly aligned buttons, inputs, and text elements with intuitive spacing, so that I can efficiently complete tasks without visual confusion or layout frustration.

Forms display with newspaper-column-inspired layouts, vintage-styled buttons with clear hover states, properly spaced input fields, and consistent alignment that guides the eye naturally through the interface workflow.

4. **LinkedIn Content Overlays** - Vintage-themed overlays and modals that integrate seamlessly with LinkedIn while maintaining newspaper aesthetics
