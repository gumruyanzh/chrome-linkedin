> Spec: UI Progress Feedback Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-19
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the LinkedIn automation extension's user interface to provide comprehensive progress feedback, intuitive controls, and accurate statistics tracking. The current core functionality works but lacks proper visual feedback for user actions and automation progress.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see real-time progress feedback when LinkedIn automation is running so I know the system is working
- As a user, I want clear start/stop button states so I know whether automation is active or inactive
- As a user, I want to see accurate connection request counters so I can track my daily activity
- As a user, I want reliable statistics in the dashboard so I can monitor my networking performance
- As a user, I want visual indicators for automation status so I can quickly understand what's happening

## Spec Scope

- Implement real-time progress indicators for automation processes
- Add proper start/stop button state management with visual feedback
- Create connection request counters with daily/total tracking
- Build comprehensive statistics dashboard with accurate metrics
- Add status indicators for different automation states (idle, running, paused, error)
- Implement progress bars or spinners for long-running operations
- Add success/error notifications for user actions

## Out of Scope

- Modifying core LinkedIn automation logic or algorithms
- Adding new automation features beyond UI improvements
- Performance optimizations unrelated to UI feedback

## Expected Deliverable

A significantly improved user interface for the LinkedIn automation extension featuring:
- Intuitive progress feedback system
- Clear visual state management
- Accurate real-time counters and statistics
- Professional and responsive UI components
- Comprehensive status indicators
